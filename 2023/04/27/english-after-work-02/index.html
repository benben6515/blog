<p>What your goal?</p>
<p>I want to reach 60&#x2F;wpm in English touch type in next 2 month, because it can make me more productivity.<br>Considering I current at 50 &#x2F; wpm in English touch type and my mother tough is not English, I think it is reasonable for me.<br>I try a lot of typing practice web sites, they are works!</p>
<p>Other’s goals</p>
<ol>
<li>Get Japanese language certificate from N2 to N1 in the next year.</li>
<li>Get coffee-tasting certificate in the next 18 months.</li>

<p>The human brain is an evolutionary disaster that we have trained to be flexible to do the things that we need in order to live the modern human life that we have.<br>Retention is the biggest failure in English leaning, bar none.</p>
<p>The human brain is not designed to record information. It is very well shaped to remember <strong>strong emotions, satisfying stories and regulars accessed information</strong>.</p>
<p>So how on Earth do I remember new words and learn grammar well?</p>
<p>Review</p>
<p>Vocabulary should generally in small amounts(10 ~ 20), and reviewed daily if possible for roughly 15~20 days. If possible, for first 7 days, you should target multiple practice sessions per day.<br>In order to move new words from short term memory to long term memory, you generally want to reviewing your memorized words times per week.<br>Once you are confident that your new words are memorized and stored in long term memory, you can review them once or twice a month to keep them fresh.<br>Sleeping is among the most important memory-related activities yo can do ; sleep is when information generally moves form short term to long term memory, and when forgetting happens.</p>

Discussions of<br>overpopulation follow a similar line of inquiry as a hypothetical event where<br>population exceeds agricultural capacity, causing famine or war over resources,<br>resulting in poverty and depopulation. Experts described overpopulation as a<br>function of overconsumption, arguing that overpopulation should be defined by a<br>population being unable to sustain itself without depleting non-renewable<br>resources.</p>
<p>Modern proponents of the concept have suggested that overpopulation, population<br>growth and overconsumption are interdependent and collectively are the primary<br>drivers of human-caused environmental problems such as climate change and<br>habitats loss. Many scientists have expressed concern about population growth,<br>and argue that creating sustainable societies will require decreasing the<br>current global population. Advocates have suggested implementation of population<br>planning strategies to reach a proposed sustainable population.</p>

During his lifetime, Van Gogh remained poor and unknown.</p>
<p>Early Life</p>
<p>Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, to upper middle-class parents. He spend his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers before traveling to The Hague. London and Paris.</p>
<p>He was deeply religious as a younger man and aspired to be a pastor, like his father, He became a teacher in England and then he worked as a missionary in a mining region in Belgium where he sketched people from the local community, and in 1885 painted his first major work <em>The Potato Eaters</em>. His work then consisted mainly of somber earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration.</p>
<p>In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. He met many artist, specially Gauguin, with whom he became friends. Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the region’s strong sunlight. His painting grew(gradually change) brighter in color, and he developed the unique(rare) and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888.</p>
<p>Van Gogh invited  Gauguin to join him in Arles, but their relationship began to deteriorate. Van Gogh admired Gauguin and desperately wanted to be treated as his qual, but Gauguin was arrogant that often frustrated Van Gogh.</p>
<p>This incident was first warriors sign of the mental health problems that were to afflict Van Gogh for the remaining days of his life. He spent time in hospitals. His works reflected the intense colors and strong light of the countryside around him. In the year of 1889, Van Gogh spent at the asylum he worked as much as the had at Arles, producing 150 paintings and hundreds of drawings.</p>
